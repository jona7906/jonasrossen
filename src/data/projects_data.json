User authentication was implemented using PHP sessions, ensuring that only authorized users could access the admin functionality.

This functionality was achieved through Ajax or Fetch requests and an API. Validation was implemented for both frontend and backend requests to ensure data integrity and security.",

Additionally, users were provided with the capability to upload an image to a designated location on the website. To create user-friendly URLs, a .htaccess file was used to rewrite the URLs, enabling easy access to all pages of the website.

          "In this project, we aimed to compare the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in distinguishing between images of dogs and cats. Our research question was to determine which machine learning model is better suited for this binary image classification task.",
          "To conduct our research, we followed a systematic approach. First, we formulated a hypothesis that CNN would outperform DNN in this task, while the null hypothesis stated that there would be no significant difference between the two models. We obtained a dataset containing images of dogs and cats and proceeded to analyze it using Python and the TensorFlow deep learning framework.",
          "During the analysis phase, we cleaned the dataset by removing corrupt image files. We then developed a DNN model with multiple layers and tested its performance on training and validation sets. Through fine-tuning, we adjusted the model's architecture by increasing the number of layers and nodes and explored regularization techniques. However, the DNN model's performance remained unsatisfactory, with an accuracy of around 0.6 on both sets.",
          "Next, we built a CNN model with convolutional and pooling layers, followed by a fully-connected layer. Initially, the CNN model outperformed the DNN model, but it showed signs of overfitting. To address this, we introduced a dropout layer and applied data augmentation to diversify the dataset. These measures helped reduce overfitting and improved the validation accuracy to above 0.8.",
          "Based on our findings, we concluded that CNN models are more effective than DNN models for binary image classification tasks. Additionally, we found that regularization techniques and data augmentation can help mitigate overfitting in CNN models. Our results support the hypothesis that a CNN model performs better than a DNN model in distinguishing between images of dogs and cats.",
          "Overall, this project provided valuable insights into the performance of different machine learning models for image classification tasks. By comparing CNN and DNN models, we gained a deeper understanding of their strengths and limitations, which can inform future research and applications in this field"

The models were evaluated based on accuracy and F1-score, with accuracy chosen as the primary performance measure.",
          "The analysis revealed that the combination of the SMOTEN re-sampling method with the Random Forest classifier achieved near-perfect accuracy, indicating its superior performance on a balanced dataset. However, it was observed that Logistic Regression and DNN models did not perform as well, even with the same re-sampling techniques applied.",
          "In conclusion, the findings suggest that the Random Forest classifier, when coupled with the SMOTEN re-sampling method, is the most effective model for accurately predicting creditworthiness. However, it is important to note that this conclusion applies specifically to the given imbalanced dataset and may not hold true for other scenarios.",
          "Overall, this project sheds light on the importance of data preprocessing techniques and model selection in dealing with imbalanced datasets in the financial domain. By comparing and evaluating multiple classification models, it provides valuable insights for credit scoring applications and highlights the potential of ensemble methods like Random Forest in such contexts."

We were provided with an API that delivered data on various server attributes, such as current speed, status (up, down, or paused), server type, and more.",
          "Through open communication with the company, we identified additional requirements: displaying the status of their meeting rooms and indicating whether they were in use or available. Armed with this information, we set out to create a comprehensive dashboard that showcased both the server status and meeting room availability.",

React enabled us to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces with reusable components, while SCSS helped us maintain a structured and maintainable CSS codebase.",
